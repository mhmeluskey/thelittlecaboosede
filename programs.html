        <p class="infant-p">The Infant Room at The Little Caboose is  a structured and nurturing environment 
            where Mom and Dad will provide our Infant Room teachers with a schedule for the 
            children that we will follow exclusively until their first birthday.  This age group has a 
            curriculum from High Scope. Their days are filled with hands on, exploratory learning 
            that promotes self confidence and group learning.</p>   
            <p class="infant2p">The teachers in this classroom 
            understand the importance of promoting education to enhance the mind, but also the 
            physical body.  We reinforce this through our menu selections, our sanitation 
            standards, and our promotion of good oral hygiene by toothbrushing throughout the 
            day. Our babies are healthy, happy, and confident, as well as brilliant by the time they 
            move on with their older friends.  Not to mention cute!</p>

            <p class ="toddler-p">We reinforce group learning to this age.  Shapes, Colors, Numbers, English, and
Spanish are all introduced during their time in this class.  Art and Sensory are
a large part of a toddler's development.  We promote major milestones such as
self-feeding, talking, and walking to this group. </p> <p class = "toddler2p">We begin to teach our toddlers how 
to interact with their friends, and communicate their wants and needs to their 
teachers through increasing their vocabulary.  We begin introducing Spanish to our 
little friends.  As we introduce our group learning, the children will follow a class 
schedule, including meal times and nap times.  Rest assured, Mom & Dad still run 
the show.  This is a fun age, with so many milestones and changes - so fun!

                    Reading, and Social Studies, and Computers - all the while still 
                    promoting fun and learning through dramatic play & art time.  Our goal 
                    is for our students to be fully prepared to embark on their next journey.  
                    Christina School District's ChildFind program will come out to the 
                    Center and evaluate our children to ensure their success in their new 
                    school.  Many of our children have moved on and our parents have 
                    reported back that their kids excel beyond expectations.</p>
