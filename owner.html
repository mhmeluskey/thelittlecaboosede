A Note from the Owner of our Center:</h2>



<div class = "message">
Dear Prospective Families,

<p>I thank you for your interest in our facility, and taking the time to research 
our day care.  Deciding who will care for your child will, without a doubt, 
be one of the hardest and most important decisions you make.  I know this 
because before I became the owner of the Little Caboose, I was a parent at 
the Center.  </p>

<p>I understand the anxiety and apprehension you are feeling right now, and 
both my husband and I cried the first day of drop-off.  Believe it or not, 
this experience can be a wonderful one.  You are essentially adding to your 
family.  That is what we are at this center, a family.  
</p>
<p>
Myself and my staff take our roles as caregivers extremely seriously.  
Without a collaborative effort, including open lines of communication and 
constant feedback, we can not be successful in raising these children.  You 
are the parent, and we never forget that.  We know that we will not do 
everything exactly the way you would at home, but we sure can try.  At The 
Little Caboose, you run the show.  We will support the decisions you make 
and assist you in any way we can to raise your child, your way.  Remember, 
I come at this from a parental perspective.  I know what I want for my 
children (who still attend the center by the way), and I venture to guess, it's 
pretty close to what you want for your children.  All of us parents 
fundamentally want the same things: a safe, healthy, fun, educational, & 
loving environment for our children when we can't be there.  I can promise 
you that is exactly what you will receive at The Little Caboose.  
</p>
<p>
If nothing else, I encourage you to give us a call.  Schedule a tour and take a 
look around.  We will be happy to take all the time we need to answer any 
questions you may have.  We will show you all of our classrooms, introduce 
you to our teachers, review our Curriculum, and discuss our policies.  I'll 
admit, we're not the cheapest center out there, but we're not the most 
expensive either.  In my mind, when it comes to your child, quality is what 
you're looking for.  Whether you pick our Center or not, you want to be 
sure that you find somewhere that takes your thoughts, opinions, 
suggestions, feedback, desires, and questions seriously.  You and your child 
deserve that.  </p>
<p>
Again, I thank you for your interest in our Center.  We look forward to 
hearing from you, and can't wait for your family to become part of our 
family.</p>

<p>Sincerely,

Ms. Kim B.
